Customer Management: Create, retrieve, and delete customer records (name, address, phone, and email).
Account Management: Manage accounts linked to customers with properties like account number, balance, and account type.
Deposits: Securely deposit funds into accounts with real-time balance updates.
Withdrawals: Process withdrawals with insufficient balance handling.
Transactions: Transfer funds smoothly between accounts, handling deposits and withdrawals.

ðŸš€ *Technologies Used*

Java 17: Core application logic.
Spring Boot: RESTful API foundation.
Spring Data JPA: Database operations.
Hibernate: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).

â¬‡ Frontend Components

App Component (AppComponent)
The main component that defines the Angular app's structure and handles routing.

Login Component (LoginComponent)
Manages user authentication by sending login credentials to the backend.

Signup Component (SignupComponent)
Allows new users to register, sending their details to the backend for account creation.

User Component (UserComponent)
Displays account dashboard, allowing users to view balance, make deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
Dynamically updates data from backend responses.

Angular Services
HTTP Client: Facilitates API requests and retrieves or updates data from the backend.

ðŸˆ¸ *Application Flow*

Frontend User Interaction:
Users access the Angular app and perform actions like Login, Signup, and Account Operations (viewing balances, deposits, withdrawals, transfers).

Backend API Calls:
Each action (Login, Account creation, Deposit) triggers an HTTP request from the Angular frontend to Spring Boot endpoints, defined in controllers (CustomerController, AccountController, etc.).
The backend controllers route these requests to services that handle business logic and interact with the database through repositories.

Database Operations:
The repository layer uses Spring Data JPA to execute queries on the database for accounts, customers, and transactions.
For instance, the AccountRepository retrieves account information, while TransactionRepository saves transaction details.

Response to Frontend:
The backend processes each request and returns JSON responses containing the requested data or confirmation of operations (e.g., successful deposit).
The Angular app updates the UI based on the backend responses, showing account balances, transaction history, and confirmation messages.

UI Updates and User Notification:
The frontend components, upon receiving data from the backend, dynamically update the UI. For example:
    Account Dashboard: Shows updated balance after deposits or withdrawals.
    Transaction History: Displays a log of transactions, reflecting deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
